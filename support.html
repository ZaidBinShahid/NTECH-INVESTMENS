                                            accessible to designated employees whom are bound by confidentiality
                                            agreements and can face termination and other consequences for breach of
                                            agreement.</p>

                                        <p>While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure
                                            and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The
                                            Internet as a whole can be insecure at times and therefore we are unable to
                                            guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>

                                    <p>If you cancel your contract with us, we will reimburse to you all payments we

                                        for any supplementary delivery charges resulting from your choice of a delivery
                                        type other than the least expensive type of standard delivery that we offer.
                                        Please note that we are permitted by law to reduce your reimbursement to reflect
                                        any reduction in the value of the goods that was caused by handling other than
                                        what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics, and functioning of
                                        the goods.</p>
                                    <p>We will provide the reimbursement without undue delay and no later than the
                                        earlier of 14 days after we receive back from you any goods supplied or 14 days
                                        after you provide proof that you have returned the goods. If no goods were
                                        supplied, then we will provide the reimbursement no later than 14 days after the
                                        day we were informed of your decision to cancel.</p>
                                    <p>If you requested the performance of services begin during the cancellation
                                        period, you are required to pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has
                                        been performed until you have communicated to us your decision to cancel this
                                        contract. We will reimburse to you any amount you have paid above this
                                        proportionate payment.</p>
                                    <p>If you provide express consent to the supply of digital content during the
                                        cancellation period and acknowledge that your right to cancel the contract is
                                        lost by the supply of digital content during the cancellation period, you will
                                        no longer have a right to cancel the contract.</p>
                                    <p>We will make the reimbursement using the same form of payment as you used for the
                                        initial purchase unless you have expressly agreed otherwise. You will not incur
                                        any fees because of the reimbursement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>This right to cancel and to reimbursement is not affected by any return or refund

                                        The Contractor does hereby waive any moral rights that the Contractor may have
                                        with respect to the Confidential Information.
                                        The Confidential Information will not include anything developed or produced by
                                        the Contractor during the term of this Agreement, including but not limited to

                                        of the Client;
                                        was developed entirely on the Contractor's own time;

                                        does not relate to the actual or demonstrably anticipated processes, research,
                                        or development of the Client; and
                                        does not result from any work performed by the Contractor for the Client.
                                        The Contractor agrees to immediately disclose to the Client all Confidential
                                        Information developed in whole or in part by the Contractor during the term of
                                        the Retainer and to assign to the Client any right, title or interest the
                                        Contractor may have in the Confidential Information. The Contractor agrees to
                                        execute any instruments and to do all other things reasonably requested by the
                                        Client (both during and after the term of the Retainer) in order to vest more

                                        Contractor to the Client.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Remedies</p>
                                    <p>The Contractor agrees and acknowledges that the Confidential Information is of a
                                        proprietary and confidential nature and that any disclosure of the Confidential
                                        Information to a third party in breach of this Agreement cannot be reasonably or
                                        adequately compensated for in money damages and would cause irreparable injury
                                        to the Client. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the Client is entitled
                                        to, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to it at law or in

                                        agents of the Contractor, from directly or indirectly committing or engaging in
                                        any act restricted by this Agreement in relation to the Confidential
                                        Information.

                                    <p>It is understood and agreed that any business opportunity relating to or similar
                                        to the Client's current or anticipated business opportunities coming to the
                                        attention of the Contractor during the Contractor's retainer is an opportunity
                                        belonging to the Client. Accordingly, the Contractor will advise the Client of
                                        the opportunity and cannot pursue the opportunity, directly or indirectly,
                                        without the written consent of the Client. Without the written consent of the
                                        Client, the Contractor further agrees not to directly or indirectly, engage or
                                        participate in any other business activities which the Client, in its reasonable
                                        discretion, determines to be in conflict with the best interests of the Client.
                                    </p>

                                    <p class="fw-bold mb-0">Return of Confidential Information</p>
                                    <p>The Contractor agrees that, upon request of the Client, or in the event that the
                                        Contractor ceases to require use of the Confidential Information, or upon
                                        expiration or termination of this Agreement, or the expiration or termination of
                                        the Retainer, the Contractor will turn over to the Client all documents, disks

                                        will give to the Client prompt written notice of such request so the Client may
                                        seek an appropriate remedy or alternatively to waive the Contractor's compliance
                                        with the provisions of this Agreement in regards to the request.

                                                been terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, it shall
                                                continue after the first minimum term of 12 months for further periods

                                                expiring on the anniversary date of this agreement.</p>
                                            <p>11.2. NTECH may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect by giving

                                            <p>11.2.1. The Customer does not comply with the terms of this Agreement;

                                            <p>11.2.2. There is reasonable evidence that the customer will not abide by

                                            <p>11.2.3. The Customer ceases trading, convenes a meeting of, or comes to

                                            <p>11.2.5. NTECH believes the Customer has allowed services to be used for
                                                any unlawful purpose or any use prohibited by this Agreement; or</p>
                                            <p>11.2.6. NTECH or the Customer, is instructed by, or receives any

                                                generates traffic which creates a situation, where the Customer owes
                                                more money to NTECH, than NTECH owes to the Customer, and the customer
                                                does not pay monies owed in the timescales agreed.</p>

                                            <p>11.3.2. either party takes any steps to wind up or dissolve, or a
                                                receiver and/or manager or administrator is appointed over any assets;

                                            <p>11.4. Termination shall be without prejudice to the rights and
