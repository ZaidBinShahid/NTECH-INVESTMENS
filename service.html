										<h4> What is a SIP Trunk?</h4>
										<p>SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol, a technology mechanism used to
											establish and terminate streaming media services containing voice and data.
											The 'trunk' element originates from legacy copper networks; it was, and in
											some cases still is, used to refer to bundles of lines shared between users.
											SIP Trunks are generally the industry standard for connecting business phone
											networks over the internet. The technology can facilitate many simultaneous
											calls and is both cost-effective and flexible.</p>

										<div class="text-center">
											<img src="assets/images/SIP.jpeg" alt="" class="rounded img-fluid">
										</div>

										<div class="mt-5">
											<h4>What is needed to connect to a SIP Trunk?</h4>
											<p class="fw-bold mt-3 mb-0">Internet Connection (or private circuit)</p>
											<p>
												Without an internet connection, the IP functionality of Voice over IP
												will not work. You need to be connected to your operator's telephone
												exchange, and via IP, this is generally done over the internet. Phone
												calls work over the internet connection when using a SIP trunk with an
												IP PBX, VoIP phone, or SIP client.</p>
										</div>

										<div>
											<p class="fw-bold mb-0">What are VoIP Phones / SIP Clients?</p>
											<p>
												These are the devices each user is going to use as a phone. They have to
												be connected to the exchange. The most commonly used office desk phone
												devices are VoIP phones. They are similar to regular phones and can be
												connected directly to the internet or to an on-premise PBX, which then
												connects either to the internet or to the PSTN TDM network via an SBC.
											</p>
										</div>

										<div>
											<h4>Why use managed voice services instead of an IP PBX?</h4>
											<p><b>Cost savings,</b>When using an IP PBX, the customer or business owner
												is responsible for setting everything up. Therefore, most enterprises
												using their own IP PBX hire professionals to do so for maintenance and
												to solve any issues that may arise. This hidden cost soon accumulates
												and may negate the savings made by using IP PBX systems in the first
												place.
											</p>
											<p>As enterprises become larger and systems become more complex, businesses
												will likely have IT support teams, and often these teams will support
												the telephony devices and PBXs. Depending on the business model, this
												could be beneficial, yet for small to medium-sized enterprises, this is
												rarely the case.

											<h4>Enterprise SIP Trunk Plus</h4>
											<p class="mb-0">We offer various mechanisms to optimize your business voice
												services. With SIP Trunk plus optional VAS Solutions, we improve the
												capabilities of your switchboard with enterprise marketing VAS add-ons,

											<h4>Wholesale SIP Trunk</h4>
											<p>This is the most basic service, often referred to as an A-Z Carrier
												Trunk. It is suitable for any size of user, from small single-line
												residential instances to larger call centers and carrier operations.
											</p>
											<p>The main thing that can be said about SIP trunk is that it is generally a
												marketing term. It refers to an IP voice connection, which can be single
												or multi-channel and can have various limitations or restrictions
												depending on the client or supplier needs.
											</p>

										<div>
											<h4>What is NTECH Investments' capacity?</h4>
											<p>We can currently handle 600 live simultaneous calls at a rate of 100
												calls per second per exchange. We have interconnected multiple exchanges
												in various data centers.</p>

											<h4>What limits are placed on clients?</h4>
											<p>Generally, we limit clients to 16 channels and between 5 to 15 calls per
												second. This avoids congestion of the TDM networks, while our central
												data centers have the capacity for hundreds of lines and calls per
												second. However, this is not necessarily true for small businesses or
												even villages. Copper network bundles still exist in remote
												destinations, and usually, these are sold in bundles of 16 channels. If
												all 16 channels were to be occupied at the same time, then the
												destination becomes blocked. We impose these limits to avoid abuse by
												call centers. We have special rates for call center traffic, where the
												limits and tolerances are less imposing. Contact us for details.</p>

										<h4>Telephone numbers for home and business use.</h4>
										<p>In many countries, it has been many years since it was necessary to lease a
											copper line circuit to obtain a telephone number. We offer telephone
											numbers, also known as DIDs, for business or personal use.
										</p>
										<p>Our numbers are unbundled, which means they can be assigned directly to you.
											In layman's terms, you don't need a dedicated landline. If you have internet
											access, then no matter where you are in the world, with a simple piece of
											software or an internet IP telephone, you can receive calls.</p>
										<p>What we refer to here as unbundling is equally compelling. Not only are you
											not tied to a dedicated circuit such as a copper phone line, but you're also
											free to solicit outbound telephony from your own SIP trunks (service
											providers) should their offers be more advantageous than what we can offer.
										</p>
										<p>How this works is we route the calls to your platform, PBX, or IP telephony
											device, and you answer the calls as they are received. Naturally, it can
											become more complex with office and carrier systems, so for enterprise, we
											also offer managed voice services.</p>

											<h4>Make your calls Pay.</h4>
											<p>Earn a passive income from your inbound calls. We 'pay as you grow'—the
												more calls you receive, the higher your revenue payments. If you have
												high volumes of inbound calls, contact us. Our analysts can assess
												potential and help grow your inbound revenues while saving costs on line
												rentals and outbound call costs.</p>
											<p><b>Unified Vanity Numbering.</b> By controlling inbound calls to multiple
												number types and directing those calls onto a single memorable number,
												the end user benefits from ease of contact. The end user can set up
												virtual attendant services, set opening hours, voicemails, and other
												prompts, while the master number can always be reached if this is the
												desired use case.</p>

											<h4>Types of Telephone Number</h4>
											<p>The following are some of the various types of numbers available and
												their key features.</p>

											<p><b>Fixed Landlines</b>are telephone numbers with a specific 'fixed' or
												'proper' geographical location area code associated with their dial
												prefix. For example, when dialed using UK dial patterns, the local dial
												prefix is 0131, or from international origins with the prefix +44131,
												the number following the prefix is associated with telephone exchanges
												within Edinburgh, Scotland. Geographical landline numbers are usually
												termed as fixed numbers, and businesses use them to portray their local
												presence and facilitate marketing.</p>
											<p><b>Cellular mobile</b> numbers, cellular numbers not normally locked to
												specific geographical cities. These numbers are typically countrywide.
												There can be different charge bands applied in calling these depending
												on commercial terms imposed by the operator or, in some instances, the
												regulatory bodies.
											</p>
											<p><b>Satellite</b> numbers are usually universal numbers not
												georgraphically
												assocated to particular countries, they are often used as the
												identifiers of roaming handsets used within aviation and maritime
												veseels.</p>
											<p><b>Universal</b> numbers are usually universal numbers not geographically
												associated with particular countries. They are often used as the
												identifiers of roaming handsets used within aviation and maritime
												vessels.
											</p>
											<p><b>IPRN, 'International Premium Rate Number.'</b> is a type of number
												used by content providers and other enterprises as a method to pay for
												various services. These offer the holder outpayments rebates which vary
												from small to large. Different payment rates can exist depending on the
												origin of traffic and volume of calls.</p>
											<p><b>Domestic Premium Rate</b> numbers are generally considered to be the
												nationally recognized country-specific premium rate numbers with the
												highest call costs, and of course, outpayment rates. In the industry,
												these are sometimes called domestic numbers and shouldn't be confused
												with proper fixed numbers.</p>
											<p><b>Country 'Wide' or 'NGN'</b> are non-geographic numbers. These service
												numbers' revenue share, accessibility, and cost to dial vary depending
												on the particular number range used as well as the source and origin
												country.
											</p>
											<p><b>Personal Numbers</b> typically formatted in a similar manner to mobile
												numbers, these are often charged at higher tariffs. Concepts envisioned
												the end users using ingress rebate to enable forwarding of the personal
												number to a mobile number; however, generally, this didn't happen. Where
												consumers have adopted these numbers, it has generally been for vanity
												patterns. Some mobile operators have been known to block calls to
												personal numbers.</p>
											<p><b>VoIP Numbers</b> Special number prefixes meant for exclusive internet
												use are a legacy from earlier times when DIDs could not be separated
												from copper TDM services. Generally, these have fallen under the
												umbrella of 'Wide NGN' numbering, with vanity patterns maintaining
												popularity.
											</p>
											<p><b>Special Service Numbers,</b> other numbers that exist are special
												numbers, like freephone/free call and shared cost. All of these expect
												the receiver of the call to pay part or all of the charges incurred.
												These are ideal for businesses wanting to make a good impression and
												bond with end clients.</p>
											<p><b>Other Number and service code types</b> local regulators will often
												provide short service codes for specialist services such as live
												operator assistance, police, fire, coastguard, and so on. Among these
												are revenue share types such as directory enquiry, or service types such
												as the speaking clock. Depending on jurisdiction and client
												requirements, we can facilitate the provision of both the service and
												number.
											</p>
											<p><b>SIP URI ENUM numbers</b> bridge the switched traditional networks and
												the
												internet by translating the numbers into internet addresses using DNS.
												These can be privately linked with or without the public domain. The
												ENUM project is not a new standard; it has been around for a couple of
												decades. However, it is growing in recognition, and a registry exists
												which is managed by the ITU-T TSB (International Telecommunications
												Union, Telephony, Telecommunications Standardization Bureau).</p>
											<p><b>In the evolving space</b> of the telecommunications industry, if you
												have
												specific use case requirements, please contact us, and we may be able to
												assist.</p>
